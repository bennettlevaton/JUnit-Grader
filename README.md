# JUnit-Grader
  A simple JUnit grader. Runs all JUnit test cases in a given file (Master File) and outputs the amount of tests failed and allows for the easy calculation of points missed and percentage on assignment.
  
# Required Edits:
  To run the program first you must open TestRunner.java and edit the necessary lines with the information required. These being entering your master JUnit test case file, deduction per missed test, and total possible points. Once entered place the .java files that need to be graded into the same folder and open up terminal. Then run the command bash run.sh.
